  \\page PageCodeStat Gecode code statistics

The following approximate breakdown into the different parts of %Gecode
gives some statistics about the amount of code and documentation 
contained in the code (as comments) where blank lines are excluded. 

The abbreviation "loc" means "lines of code" and "lod" means "lines of 
documentation".
